                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>We are called to be a reproducing church that is rooted in Christ, united in love, and devoted to establishing the Kingdom of God by proclaiming and demonstrating the gospel, making disciples, and planting churches throughout Riverside, the Inland Empire, the nation, and the ends of the earth.</p>
                <p class="verse"><i>I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one--as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-John 17:21</p>
                <p class="verse"><i>Jesus came and told his disciples, “I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth. Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations," baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this: I am with you always, even to the end of the age.”</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-Matthew 28:18-20</p>
                <p class="verse"><i>The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free, and that the time of the Lord’s favor has come.&nbsp;&nbsp;-Luke 4:18-19</i></p>
                <p class="verse"><i>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere - in Jerusalem,throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.</i>&nbsp;&nbsp;-Acts 1:8</p>
                <a class="btn btn-default btn-lg" href="#" data-featherlight="#fl1">Our Statement of Faith</a>
                <div class="lightbox" id="fl1">
                    <h3>Union Church Statement of Faith</h3>
                    <p> We make this confession as a covenant for faith and practice. In humility we admit our
                        human imperfection and inability to fully comprehend the width and length and height and
                        depth of God’s love. We acknowledge that we can know God only as he chooses to reveal
                        himself. And we believe that nothing can separate us from God’s love.</p>

                     <p>We believe in one true God, the LORD, the living God, who is eternally existent in a loving unity
                        of three equally-divine persons: Father, Son and Holy Spirit.</p>

                     <p>We believe in God, the creator, sustainer, and ruler of all things seen and unseen, who is love;
                        who is infinitely perfect, holy, righteous, and just in all his ways; who has limitless knowledge
                        and power; and who is everywhere present.</p>

                     <p>We believe God has revealed himself and his will from the beginning, through nature and
                        history, through prophets and saints, through Scripture, and ultimately and perfectly through
                        his Son, Jesus Christ, and through his Spirit. God has graciously purposed and acted from
                        eternity to redeem a people for himself and to make all things new for his own glory.
                        Therefore we offer all of our lives as an act of worship to God. We seek to worship the one true
                        God in spirit and in truth, in word and in deed. We seek to be one as God is one, a loving,
                        inclusive community that works for justice, righteousness, and holiness, that seeks just
                        relationships with all of creation, as God has spoken and continues to speak to his creation.
                        We believe in Jesus Christ, the Lord, the only Son of God, the eternal Word, of one being with
                        the Father and the Spirit, through whom all things were made.</p>

                     <p>We believe that Jesus Christ is God in the flesh, God with us, the perfect image of God, who
                        came because of God’s love for the world, so that those who trust in him may have life in its
                        fullness. Christ made known to us the true nature of God, and is the fulfillment of God’s
                        redemptive plan.</p>

                     <p>We believe Jesus Christ was fully God and fully man, one person in two natures. We believe
                        that Christ, Israel's promised Messiah, was conceived through the Holy Spirit and born of the
                        virgin Mary. Anointed by the Spirit, he dwelt among us, full of grace and truth, lived a sinless
                        life, and taught and showed us how to live. Proclaiming and inaugurating God’s Kingdom, he
                        brought justice to the oppressed and bread to the hungry, freeing those who were bound and
                        healing the sick, supporting and protecting the downtrodden, the stranger, the orphan and the
                        widow. He commissioned all believers to preach the Gospel and to make disciples of all nations.
                        We believe in Christ’s vicarious, all-sufficient, and atoning death on the cross, which freed us
                        from the power of sin and reconciled us to God. He arose bodily from the dead on the third day,
                        conquering death and opening the way to eternal life. His death and resurrection constitute the
                        only ground for salvation.</p>

                     <p>We believe Christ ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the Father as our
                        High Priest and Advocate, the only mediator between God and humanity. He will come again in
                        glory to judge the living and the dead. God's redemptive purpose will be consummated by the
                        return of Christ; Christ will establish his glorious kingdom, and his kingdom will have no end.
                        Therefore we bow before Christ, believing in and confessing him as Lord, and sharing the good
                        news of the Kingdom with all people. We humbly accept the grace and fullness of life he has
                        given to us. We seek to follow the public mission of Jesus Christ, loving as he loves, making
                        disciples of all nations. We seek to respond to the cries of the oppressed and downtrodden,
                        dwelling with them as Christ dwells with us. We eagerly await his return, clinging to the hope he
                        has given us, and live with confidence in the newness and fullness of life.</p>

                     <p>We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, who eternally proceeds from the Father
                        and the Son, who was sent by Christ after his resurrection and ascension, and who glorifies and
                        reveals the Lord Jesus Christ. With the Father and the Son he is worshiped and glorified.</p>

                     <p>We believe the Spirit has spoken through the prophets, making known God’s plan for salvation,
                        and continues to speak and work today, leading us into all truth, and enabling us to serve and
                        to grow in the likeness of Christ.</p>

                     <p>We believe that the Holy Spirit speaks to all people, penetrating to the inmost of the soul,
                        enabling us to respond to the call of Jesus, persuading us to repent of our sins and confess Jesus
                        as Lord. By the same Spirit we are led to trust in divine mercy, whereby we are forgiven,
                        justified, and granted the free gift of eternal life.</p>

                     <p>We believe the Holy Spirit regenerates sinners, and in the Spirit we are baptized into union with
                        Christ and adopted as heirs in the family of God.</p>

                     <p>We believe God has poured out his Spirit in abundance, that the Spirit indwells, protects,
                        comforts, purifies, enlivens, renews, leads, and graciously empowers the Church. The Spirit is a
                        gift from the Father; the Spirit breathes new life and bestows upon all believers spiritual gifts,
                        filling and empowering us for ministry, mission, witness, and for the building up of His church in
                        love.</p>

                     <p>Therefore we accept the gracious infilling and purification of the Spirit. We offer ourselves as
                        vessels of the Spirit, trusting and seeking the Spirit’s wisdom and guidance, glorifying Jesus, and
                        living as a Spirit-filled and empowered community. We seek to be a community in which the
                        presence of the Holy Spirit is evident in love and harmony, with God, with ourselves, with our
                        neighbors, and with all creation. We seek to help and equip people to discover, grow in, and use
                        their God-given gifts, to the glory of God.</p>

                     <p>We believe that God’s creation is good, for it is the work of a single loving God, who declared it
                        good, and who sustains and directs it. All of creation belongs to its creator, and God has made a
                        covenant with all creation.</p>

                     <p>We believe that humankind was created in the image of God, that we might have fellowship
                        with God. We are called by God as partners in creation and redemption, to enjoy creation and
                        to care for it in accordance with God’s purposes. As the image of God, humankind is free to
                        make choices, to love, to create, to reason, and to live in harmony with creation and with God;
                        all people can respond to the love of God and are deserving of love, acceptance, and respect.
                        We believe that all have sinned and rebelled, and all need to repent of their sins. The wages of
                        sin is death, and therefore all are in need of redemption, salvation, and grace.</p>

                     <p>We believe in the forgiveness of sins, in cleansing from unrighteousness, in the rebirth by the
                        Spirit, which are freely offered to all through the work of Jesus Christ. Only through God’s
                        saving work in Christ can we be rescued, reconciled and renewed, united to Christ, and brought
                        into his eternal kingdom.</p>

                     <p>We believe in the resurrection of the body, and the life of the world to come, which is given to
                        those who are saved. Only through faith and the acceptance of God’s grace and love, through
                        regeneration by the Spirit, which is made manifest in works, can we receive eternal life and
                        escape eternal separation from God.</p>

                     <p>Therefore we accept this gift of grace, confessing and repenting of our sins, holding fast to the
                        hope that has been given us. We seek to be co-laborers with Christ, ministers of reconciliation,
                        sharing the good news of the Gospel with all creation. We partner with God in his redemptive
                        plan in our homes, in our neighborhoods, in our cities, in our regions, and in all the world,
                        treating all creation with respect and serving all humanity as God’s image-bearers. We do this
                        recognizing that God is our help, that we are in desperate need of his love and grace.</p>

                     <p>We believe in one holy universal and apostolic Church, of which our Lord Jesus Christ is the
                        head, and of which all who believe are members. United in love and faith, the Church is called
                        out from every place and every people, to continue the fellowship and teaching of the apostles,
                        to go into the world, to preach the Gospel, and to make disciples of all nations.</p>

                     <p>We believe the true Church is manifest in local churches, redemptive communities of Jesus
                        filled with the Holy Spirit and deeply embedded in their particular contexts. The local church is
                        called to care for each other, to worship together, to fellowship and pray together, to declare
                        the good news of God’s Kingdom, to equip and disciple its members, and to visually
                        demonstrate the worship and love of Christ to the world.</p>

                     <p>Therefore we submit to the lordship of Christ, and we worship God with our whole lives. We
                        respond to God’s commission, to go into all the world to preach the Gospel and to make
                        disciples of every nation, and we ask the Holy Spirit to embolden and empower us as we
                        respond. We seek to equip the people of God for works of service, to help every member find his
                        or her place in the body. We seek to love God supremely and love others sacrificially, having
                        compassion and promoting justice, peace and love.</p>

                     <p>We believe the Bible, the Holy Scriptures, to be the divinely-inspired, infallible, authoritative
                        word of God. The Bible constitutes the word of God because God inspired its human authors
                        and because God still speaks to us through it.</p>

                     <p>We believe the Bible is God’s self-revelation of himself and of his will for salvation. Because of
                        this, it is the only infallible rule of faith and practice, ultimately normative and authoritative for
                        how we live and what we believe.</p>

                     <p>We believe that the Bible must be interpreted and applied as a community, guided by the Spirit,
                        accountable to Church orthodoxy and tradition, with Christ the living Word as the ultimate
                        center around which Scripture is understood and preached.</p>

                     <p>Therefore we submit to the Bible as our rule of faith and practice, seeking to take part in God’s
                        redemptive story. We seek to be faithful to scripture and orthodox in our teaching and
                        preaching, accountable to God and to each other.</p>

                <h3>Community</h3>

                <h3>Mission</h3>
                <p>We seek to follow the public mission of Christ, commissioned to preach the gospel, to make disciples of all people, to seek justice for the oppressed, and to reconcile creation to God.</p>

Life Groups are the place where our faith grows feet and our priorities are put into practice.</p>

                <h3>Pray</h3>
                <p>Prayer is the single most important thing you can contribute!  Every work of God must be born in prayer and sustained by prayer. We recognize that there is no strategy, ministry model, or amount of hard work that can produce any lasting fruit without the presence and power of God. We must be completely dependent on Jesus Christ and the empowering presence of the Holy Spirit if anything of eternal value is going to take place.  So, please, above all else, pray for Union Church and the city of Riverside.</p>
